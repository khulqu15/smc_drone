# Sliding Mode Control

Sliding mode control (SMC) is a type of robust control method that is used to stabilize systems that are subject to uncertainties, such as drones. It is a nonlinear control technique that uses a sliding surface to ensure that the system's state remains within a certain region.

In the context of drones, the sliding mode controller (SMC) is used to stabilize the drone's position, velocity and attitude. The SMC algorithm takes in the desired position and velocity of the drone, as well as the current position and velocity of the drone, and generates control inputs to drive the drone towards the desired state.

The main advantage of SMC is that it is robust to parameter variations, external disturbances and model uncertainties, which makes it a suitable control method for drones that operate in unpredictable environments.

It's important to note that the implementation of SMC algorithm for a drone is a complex task, and it requires a deep understanding of the drone's dynamics, control theory and the environment. Also, the tuning of the controller's parameters is crucial, and it needs to be done experimentally.
